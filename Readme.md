# OpenVR-KeyboardInput 

An OpenVR client that sends input from a HID keyboard to a openvr driver into a virtual vr controller


### Profiles
You can save different settings by creating a "New Profile".
If you want to update a profile with new settings you need to select the profile and delete it and re-create a "New Profile".

If you name a profile with the name "default" it will be the initially loaded profile once you start SteamVR. If you dont want to automatically enable keyboard input on startup save the default profile with "enableKI" unchecked.


### INI settings
You can modify all of the profiles from the ini file 
 at `C:\Users\<USERNAME>\AppData\Roaming\pottedmeat7\OpenVRKeyboardInput.ini` 

You can add custom keyboard to VR input mappings as follows
find the `inputMappings` key in the correct profile your changing such as 
```
keyboardInputProfiles\<profile_index>\inputMappings="87,4:65,3:83,6:68,5:"
```
Keyboard codes are here https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/inputdev/virtual-key-codes

And the available VR buttons are
```
k_EButton_System			= 0,
k_EButton_ApplicationMenu	= 1,
k_EButton_Grip				= 2,
k_EButton_DPad_Left			= 3,
k_EButton_DPad_Up			= 4,
k_EButton_DPad_Right		= 5,
k_EButton_DPad_Down			= 6,
k_EButton_A					= 7,
```
There is a timeout of frames to ensure the keyboard state is accurate this variable by default waits 5 calls to keyboard state
This works for my processor, which has one state that key is held down followed by three states that say the key is released (even though it actually is still held down). The fourth call says the key is held down again, so this timeout is necessary. Im not too sure this timeout has anything to due with processor speed or queueing of system messages (keyboard state etc.). The variable of 5 may need to be changed for other systems. The variable can be changed from the profiles with a line in the profile as `keyboardInputProfiles\<profile_index>\keyReleaseTO=5` 
Note if this variable needs to much larger, there will be a delay in stopping the VR input.

## Setting up To Re-Build the project from Source
*You do not need this if you just want to use the WIP overlay*

### Boost
- WINDOWS
	1. Goto https://sourceforge.net/projects/boost/files/boost-binaries/1.65.1/
	2. Download Boost 1.65 Binaries (boost_1_65_1-msvc-14.1-64.exe)
	3. Install Boost into `OpenVR-KeyboardInput/third-party/boost_1_65_1`
- LINUX
	1. Go to https://sourceforge.net/projects/boost/files/boost/1.65.1/
	2. Download boost_1_65_1.tar.gz
	3. Extract the files into `OpenVR-KeyboardInput/third-party/boost_1_65_1`
  
### Qt
1. Goto https://download.qt.io/official_releases/qt/5.9/5.9.0/
2. Download Qt 5.9.0 (Either windows .exe or linux .run file)
3. Run the Qt installer (I installed it to `c:\Qt` or `/home/<user>/` on linux)
4. Run the following script: <OpenVR-KeyboardInput path>/client_overlay/bin/windeployqt.bat

## Building
- WINDOWS
	Build *'VRKeyboardInput.sln'* in Visual Studio 2017
- LINUX	
	Build the OpenVR-KeyboardInputOverlay.pro project with Qt Creator 
	from a shell run
	`./build.sh`
	go to https://github.com/probonopd/linuxdeployqt/releases and download the AppImage
	then run
	`cd <OpenVR-KeyboardInput path>/client_overlay/bin/x64/
	<linuxdeployqt path>/linuxdeployqt-5-x86_64.AppImage OpenVR-KeyboardInputOverlay -qmldir=res/qml/ -no-translations -bundle-non-qt-libs -appimage -verbose=2`

### Building installer
1. go to https://sourceforge.net/projects/nsis/files/NSIS%202/2.33/
2. download and run the nsis-2.33-setup.exe
3. go to `OpenVR-KeyboardInput/installer`
4. right click the `installer.nsi` file and `Compile NSIS Script`
5. the installer exe will be built into the same directory

## Uninstall
1. Run "C:\Program Files\OpenVR-KeyboardInput\Uninstall.exe" will remove everything

# Known Bugs

- The shared-memory message queue is prone to deadlock the driver when the client crashes or is exited ungracefully.
